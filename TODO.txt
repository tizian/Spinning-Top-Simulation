Todo
----

- ST1 tips over? (But ST3 doesn't...)
- shadow mapping
- fix collision handling with plane -> pixar pdf
- ground friction -> not sure yet.
- arbitrary mesh-mesh collision: pairwise triangle-triangle intersection tests for detection -> pixar pdf for handling the actual collisions (edge, plane vs edge, edge collisions)
- resting contacts (maybe simplified version as ground isn't really a rigid body) -> pixar pdf
- pause simulation and rewinding
- GUI with labels which buttons can be pressed and their impact
- Sound (collision, fritcion, fade out)
- st1, 2 disappear if they rotate too fast (they tip over on their own (unknown why))
- Texturing: wood, steel, real life (st3)
- introduce state objects to allow better timesteps and rewind.
- test big timesteps. Current implementation should be able to handle those (bisection), but probably doesn't :-/
- change mass to inverse mass (useful to simulate objects with infinite mass)

Done
----

- decrease CPU and GPU usage. Even with one simple Spinning top and the ground, quite high usage.
- Fix 'L' key
- correct normal of lower ground to make it darker
- change m_orientation of RigidBody to quaternion.
- change repository to GIT
- loading screen (or faster loading ^^) (http://www.glfw.org/documentation.html as reference)
- More spinning top models
- planar shadows
- st1, 2, 3 etc disappear when colliding upsidedown
- slow motion
