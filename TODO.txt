- (done) decrease CPU and GPU usage. Even with one simple Spinning top and the ground, quite high usage.
- (done) Fix 'L' key
- (done) correct normal of lower ground to make it darker
- (done) change m_orientation of RigidBody to quaternion.

- Shadows -> probably quite a bit of refactoring to handle multiple shaders :-/
- loading screen (or faster loading ^^) (http://www.glfw.org/documentation.html as reference)
- change repository to GIT
- fix collision handling with plane -> pixar pdf
- ground friction -> not sure yet.
- arbitrary mesh-mesh collision: pairwise triangle-triangle intersection tests for detection -> pixar pdf for handling the actual collisions (edge, plane vs edge, edge collisions)
- resting contacts (maybe simplified version as ground isn't really a rigid body) -> pixar pdf
- More spinning top models
